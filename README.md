# EDC Software — Blender Extensions Repository

The Blender extensions repository for the products of **Engineering
Dynamics Company**: add it to Blender once, and Blender offers installs
and automatic update notifications for every EDC product.

| Product | Repository |
|---------|------------|
| CamMatch™ | [edccorp/CamMatch](https://github.com/edccorp/CamMatch) |
| HVE Toolkit™ | [edccorp/HVEToolkit](https://github.com/edccorp/HVEToolkit) |
| Point Cloud Toolkit™ | [edccorp/PointCloudToolkit](https://github.com/edccorp/PointCloudToolkit) |
| Recon Toolkit™ | [edccorp/ReconToolkit](https://github.com/edccorp/ReconToolkit) |

## Add to Blender (4.2+)

1. Open **Edit → Preferences → Get Extensions**.
2. Open the **Repositories** dropdown (top-right) and click **+ → Add Remote Repository**.
3. Paste the repository URL:

   ```
   https://extensions.edccorp.com/index.json
   ```

4. Name it **EDC Software** and confirm.

The EDC products then appear in the extensions list to install, and
Blender notifies you when updates are available.

## How it works

- `tools/build_index.py` fetches the **latest GitHub release** of each
  product, downloads its zip, reads the `blender_manifest.toml` inside it
  (the manifest is the source of truth for id/name/version), and writes
  `index.json` in Blender's remote-repository format plus an `index.html`
  landing page.
- The add-on zips are **mirrored into the published site**
  (`packages/*.zip`), so customers can install and update even while the
  product repos are private. Set `MIRROR_ZIPS=0` in the workflow to point
  at the GitHub release assets directly instead (only works once the
  product repos are public).
- **Required setup while the product repos are private:** add a
  `PRODUCTS_TOKEN` repository secret (a fine-grained personal access
  token with **Contents: read** on every product repo, hidden ones
  included). The default
  workflow token can only see this repo, so without the secret every
  product is skipped and the index publishes empty.
- The **Publish extensions index** workflow runs the script and deploys
  the result to GitHub Pages. It runs every 6 hours, on every push to
  `main`, and on demand (**Actions → Publish extensions index → Run
  workflow**) — run it manually right after cutting a product release to
  publish the update immediately.
- Products whose latest release zip contains no manifest (releases cut
  before extension support) are skipped with a log message and appear
  automatically once a new release is published.

To publish instantly from a product repo instead of waiting for the
schedule, send a `repository_dispatch` event (type `product-release`) to
this repo from the product's release workflow.

## Maintainer notes

- Add a new product by appending its `owner/repo` to `PRODUCTS` in
  `tools/build_index.py`, and add the repo to both the `PRODUCTS_TOKEN`
  Actions secret and the gateway's `GH_TOKEN` PAT.
- Keep a product off the public site (internal or beta tools) by adding
  its manifest `id` to `HIDDEN_PRODUCTS`. It still ships in `index.json`
  and `packages.json`, so a repository secret entitled to it installs and
  updates it in Blender as usual — it just gets no catalog listing and no
  product page.
- If a product publishes its releases as GitHub **pre-releases**, also add
  its `owner/repo` to `PRERELEASE_PRODUCTS`; otherwise the "latest
  release" lookup finds nothing and the product is skipped.
- Test locally: `python tools/build_index.py /tmp/site` (set
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` to avoid API rate limits), then open `/tmp/site/index.html`.
- The site is served at the custom domain `extensions.edccorp.com`
  (configured in the Pages settings); the underlying
  `edccorp.github.io/blender-extensions` URL redirects to it. If the
  domain ever changes, update `PAGES_BASE` in `tools/build_index.py`.
