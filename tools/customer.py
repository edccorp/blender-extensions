"""Manage customer repository secrets for the EDC Software extensions gateway.

The customer list lives as customers.json in a private GitHub repo; the
gateway (extensions.edccorp.com) re-reads it within about a minute of any
change, so adding or revoking a customer never touches Railway and needs
no redeploy. Every change is a git commit — the repo history is the audit
trail.

One-time setup on your machine:
    set CUSTOMERS_ADMIN_TOKEN=github_pat_...
        (fine-grained PAT with Contents: read & write on the customers
         repo ONLY — do not reuse the gateway's read-only GH_TOKEN)
    set CUSTOMERS_REPO=edccorp/edc-extensions-customers
        (optional; this is the default)

Usage:
    python tools/customer.py add "Acme Reconstruction LLC" --email buyer@acme.com
    python tools/customer.py add "Smith Engineering" --products recon_toolkit,point_cloud_toolkit
    python tools/customer.py list
    python tools/customer.py needs-email
    python tools/customer.py set-email "Acme Reconstruction LLC" buyer@acme.com
    python tools/customer.py add-email "Acme Reconstruction LLC" it@acme.com cad@acme.com
    python tools/customer.py remove-email "Acme Reconstruction LLC" cad@acme.com
    python tools/customer.py show buyer@acme.com
    python tools/customer.py reissue "Acme Reconstruction LLC"
    python tools/customer.py set-products "Smith Engineering" --products "*"
    python tools/customer.py revoke "Acme Reconstruction LLC"

A customer who has lost their secret is looked up with `show`, by name,
email or the secret itself — the gateway deliberately refuses to re-display
one to anyone who only proved they can type an email address, and points
them here instead. Use `reissue` when the secret may have been seen by
somebody else rather than merely mislaid: sending the same one back cannot
help when the problem is who else has it.
