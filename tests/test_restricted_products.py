"""A wildcard covers the catalogue, not the internal tools.

HIDDEN_PRODUCTS keeps a product off the public site. It does not keep it
out of the index, and it never kept it out of anyone's hands: "*" meant
literally everything, so every customer holding one -- which is the
compact plain-string form, and therefore most of them -- could install an
internal or beta tool the moment it entered the index. Absence from a
catalogue is not access control.
