"""Who has which version, in a form that can be read back.

GitHub's release download_count answers neither half of that question: on a
private repo it counts authenticated fetches of every kind, and it carries no
identity at all. Measured once on v0.49.2 of one toolkit, it stood at 20
against a single gateway request in the window.

The gateway is the only place that knows who asked. It was saying so to
stdout, where the answer survives as long as log retention and is not
queryable even then. So the stamp goes on the customer, in the file that is
already the record of who may have what.

What these tests hold is the part that could go wrong quietly: that recording
a download never changes what anyone is entitled to, that a secret does not
end up somewhere it need not be, and that failing to write the note never
costs anyone the file.
